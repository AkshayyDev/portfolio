## Description

In this project, I implemented the paper **[Effect of wax based and polymer based additives on the mechanical properties of reclaimed asphalt pavement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tQMhVJwhGpne7B8lqEWgLNWSX_nOXC7r/view?usp=sharing)**, which was published in the conference proceedings of the _National Conference on Innovations in Civil Engineering Practices_ **NCICEP 2022**.
I conducted a comprehensive laboratory study where I manufactured asphalt mixes using reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). These mixes were classified into two, namely modified and unmodified mixes. The modified mixes were made using the additives named Sasobit and Zycotherm.

My objective was to evaluate the impact of these additives on the stiffness, rut resistance and moisture sensitivity of the mixes. To achieve this, I conducted several tests including wheel rut testing, moisture resistance testing, and indirect stiffness testing. 
Through these rigorous assessments, I was able to analyze the effects of the additives on the performance of the asphalt mixes.
The modified mixes showed improved moisture resistance and reduced stiffness.

**ITS Test Results**

Stiffness of  mixes were reduced by the addtiton of additives.

**TSR Test Results**

The TSR values modified mixes were higher than that of control mixes. Hence the additive addition improved moisture resistance

**Wheel Rut Test Results**

The stiffness of control mix was high and it produced the least rut depth. The additives reduced the rut resistance.

By carefully considering these findings, future asphalt mix designs can be optimized to ensure superior durability and performance in real-world road construction projects.
