## Description

My interest in road pavements led me to delve into the study of Recycled Asphalt Pavements (RAP). This exploration prompted me to leverage my theoretical knowledge to author a review paper, examining the performance analysis of RAP.

 **[Review paper on performance analysis of WMA-RAP mixtures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E85_bSSKQ9TXcTka6pM_fvisfQrhx4ol/view?usp=sharing)**. This paper was presented at the **[International Conference on Innovations in Civil Engineering ICICEâ€“ 2022](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GJV7CNsXrnfpmkNozCpNow6oC3IOt39K/view?usp=sharing)**  and has been published in the conference proceedings

The utilization of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) in Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) has the potential to yield several advantages. WMA is characterized by a lower mix temperature, enhancing sustainability and reducing energy consumption. Moreover, WMA offers improved workability during construction. However, WMA's reliability in terms of rutting resistance is not consistent. On the other hand, RAP, although limited in terms of the allowable addition amount, provides better rutting resistance due to it's high stiffness. RAP in WMA aslo improve moisture resitance Therefore, the incorporation of RAP in WMA presents a potential opportunity to harness the benefits of both technologies. Nonetheless, the incorporation of RAP in WMA may lead to reduced workability due to the siffness of RAP.

By the usage of additives more RAP inclusion in mix is possible, since the addtives can reduce the stiffness of RAP. Morevover, combing RAP-WMA and addtives together can result in a high temperature performance.
