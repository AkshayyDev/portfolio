## Description
As far as practicability of production platforms are concerned, installation of fixed platform in deep
waters is an uneconomical owing to its base width and depth. In the same way floating type
platforms cannot provide safe working environment since its motion responses are very
severe by virtue of the harsh sea state at offshore regions. So a synthesis in structural concept
has been formulated considering the behavior of both fixed and floating platforms to the
generation of new system of production platform in the name of tension leg platform. In the
present design project a TLP with a volume displacement of 80000KN has been designed. In
the design process the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic and structural safety factors are considered.
Dynamic response analysis in times of surge response and heave response are also
made to substantiate completeness and sufficiency of geometric form of the platform design .In this project I only considered the approximate design of a TLP. For the real analysis, finite element method can be used in softwares like SACS.

## Results
The Geometric configuration of TLP for 80000KN volume displacement has been in
conformity with the different aspects of existing TLPs covering the comprehensive and
perspective design procedure

The frame work for supporting the deck slab consists of stiffeners, tubular members for beam
elements, primary girders and secondary girders. The depth of girders in both primary and
secondary was designed as 5m.The maximum span for secondary girders is 37m and that for
primary girders is 31m.The columns has been designed for combined effect of bending, axial
compression and hydrostatic pressure. Then overall sufficiency of members under hydrodynamic loading has been checked after considering single degree of freedom motion
under heave and surge.
