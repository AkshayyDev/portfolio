## Description

This **[review paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oNfG9I9nSHVZyBxBOubUXjc5SGLwBcmR/view?usp=sharing)** was written after conducting extensive literature study to find out the challenges of using RAP in road pavements.

Partial Blending, Reduced workability, Fatigue Cracking and Low temperature cracking were the major chanllenges of implmenting RAP materilas in an Asphalt Mix.

By adopting a modifed mix design, in which RAP is segregated into Fine(<=4.75mm) and Coarse RAP(>4.75mm), the phenomen of partial blending can be minimized. This mix design has a better performance than traditional mix design.

Adding recycling agents in the RAP mix can prevent the detrimental effects of binder aging. These agents effectively mitigate stiffness and restore the desirable properties of aged binders, leading to improved workability.

Addition of Glass fibers can also improve the Crack resistance of RAP mixes.
