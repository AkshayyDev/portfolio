## Description

I have joined the **[Appen crowd scouring company](https://appen.com/crowd-2/#crowd)** to work as a part time Search Engine Evaluator in the **[Microsoftâ€™s Universal Human Relevance System (UHRS)](https://prod.uhrs.playmsn.com/UHRS/)** 
I was able to work this crowd sourcing platfrom by efficiently utilizing the time available during the Pandemic lockdown.

- Analysed and judged more than 60 hit apps with more than 85% accuracy by effectively studying and interpreting the guidelines of the hit apps. 

- Completed about 14hrs of internet judging on a day, depending upon the availability of hit apps
