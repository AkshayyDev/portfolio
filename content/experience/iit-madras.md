## Description
- Conducted performace analysis of the Asphalt Mixes at the laboratory of **[NATPAC](https://natpac.kerala.gov.in/)** 

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Marshall samples were prepared using additives namely Sasobit and Zycotherm
=======
- Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for 6-DoF Global Pose Regression and Odometry Estimation
- Developed a deep learning model in TensorFlow to estimate the camera pose from consecutive monocular images
- The model demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional feature-based visual localization algorithms, especially in texture-less regions
- The neural network was later utilized for robot localization in GPS-denied environments

- Wheel rut test was done on additive modified and unmodified asphalt mixes with 100% RAP.

- The results were such that the rut depth of modified mixes were increased by 35% and 75% respectively.
