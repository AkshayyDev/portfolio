## Description

Soon after my graduation, I joined **[ITS Planners and Engineers Private Limited (ITSPE)](https://www.itspe.co.in/about-us)**, as an Intern . Owing to my excellent performance, I was offered a permanent position to work as a Trainee. I was tasked to work on the ATCS (Adaptive Traffic Control Systems) projects and Public Transit Management projects in India.
